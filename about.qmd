QC-GIS is a regional GIS user group for the Quad Cities area. Establishing a GIS User Group in the QC area creates a network of partnerships with local organization and educational institutions. It provides essential professional involvement in our local community, strengthens existing partnerships, and creates access to a pool of local GIS knowledge and resources.
